# InventoryManagement
GUI used to manage business Inventory in an SQL database.

This is a basic Python GUI project using Tkinter and SQLlite to create an Invenotry Management application. I made this for a professional setting
and is admittedly held together by band-aids. Regardless, thought it'd be cool to add pubically so here we are! 

If you are interested in testing this program yourself, go through the 'inventory.pyw' file and swap out the example variables with information that applies to 
your environment and run.
